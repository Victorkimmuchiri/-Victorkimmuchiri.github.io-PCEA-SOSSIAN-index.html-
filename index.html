					<P>Noor Investments Limited understands this and teaches all of its employees the Defensive Driving. We do not teach one how to drive; instead, we teach driving techniques called the Five Keys to Space Cushion Driving that, when practiced, will give more space for the vehicle, better visibility for the driver, and more time to make proper driving decisions. The goal is to have fewer accidents; however, improved fuel economy, lower maintenance costs, and reduced stress for the driver are additional benefits.
